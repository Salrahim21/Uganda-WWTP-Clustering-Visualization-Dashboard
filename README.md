# 🚰 Uganda Wastewater Treatment Plant Clustering Dashboard 🌍

This project visualizes and analyzes **Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)** across **Uganda** using geospatial clustering, treatment type analysis, and capacity insights. Built with **Dash**, **Plotly**, and **scikit-learn**, the app allows interactive exploration of Uganda’s wastewater infrastructure.
